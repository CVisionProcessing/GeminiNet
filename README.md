Delving into the Impact of Saliency Detector: A GeminiNet for Accurate Saliency Detection
We implement a model to fulfill the saliency object detection (SOD). We employ deep learning method to extract features, and then, the classical method, Nearest Neighbor, are used to classify each pixel and to fulfille the detection task. 
The code will be available soon. 
The models can be obtained at https://pan.baidu.com/s/13gWxZLODplSPWGiDXZ18GQ, extraction code:67fc
